# FAQ
## 1. Why do the colors in the preview sometimes differ from the final image?
No Fusion's default format is **HEIF**<span style="color:#FF0000; font-weight:bold">+</span>, achieved through the ProRAW pipeline and No Fusion's proprietary calibration and compression algorithms. The preview is processed through the default pipeline, so in some cases, there may be color differences between the two. If you want colors closer to the viewfinder, you can use the **HEIF** format, though you will lose the de-sharpening feature.

## 2. Can standard iPhones use No Fusion?
Yes, No Fusion is a camera that heavily utilizes the RAW pipeline. Since standard iPhones and devices prior to the iPhone 11 Pro do not support ProRAW shooting, compression is only possible through regular Bayer RAW files. However, compared to ProRAW, standard RAW files are less advantageous in terms of dynamic range and noise control, and they may differ more from the preview. Therefore, when using the **HEIF**<span style="color:#FF0000; font-weight:bold">+</span> format, this is something to keep in mind.

However, using the **HEIF** format can avoid these issues, and you will still be able to use all of No Fusion's features.

## 3. Why does the default camera's telephoto lens focus, but No Fusion doesn't?
As iPhone telephoto lenses continue to extend in range, their minimum focusing distance has also increased. Therefore, when shooting close objects, Apple automatically switches back to the main camera to simulate telephoto cropping without the user's knowledge. You can see which lens was used in the photo's metadata in the gallery.

However, No Fusion is designed not to switch lenses automatically, so if the telephoto lens is too close to the object, it may not be able to focus.

## 4. Why is there no macro mode?
The native camera's macro mode is achieved by cropping from the ultra-wide-angle lens. If you want to use macro mode, you can switch to the ultra-wide lens and crop with custom focal length settings.

## 5. Why is the save time long?
If **HEIF**<span style="color:#FF0000; font-weight:bold">+</span>, MAX, and Live Photo are all enabled simultaneously, save times may be longer because the amount of data that needs to be processed increases, putting a high load on the system. You can adjust the MAX resolution to 24MP in the image size settings to alleviate this issue. No Fusion will also continue optimizing photo save speeds.

## 6. Lock Screen Camera Widget
Through the camera control button, or by adding No Fusion to the buttons below the lock screen interface, you can open the lock screen camera widget without unlocking your phone. Unlike opening the app normally, the lock screen camera widget has several limitations.

1. Photos taken cannot be added to the No Fusion album.
2. Cannot read user-imported presets.
3. Please do not exit the widget before saving is complete, otherwise photos will be lost.
4. Tap "Unlock" in the upper right corner of the screen to launch the main app.

If you want to unlock and launch the main app by default every time you start, you can add "Unlock and Launch No Fusion" to the lock screen control widget, and use the Action Button or lock screen lens selection widget to directly unlock and open the app.

## 7. Why doesn't the MAX toggle work?
Enabling the MAX toggle allows you to capture photos up to 48MP, but the MAX toggle will not work in the following situations:

- Hardware does not support 48MP lenses.
- Non-ProRAW compatible iPhones when shooting HEIF+ or RAW.
- In manual mode when multi-frame fusion is disabled.

## 8. Duplicate charges
If you do not cancel your subscription before the end of the trial week, it will be charged automatically after the trial ends. Also, because lifetime premium membership and annual subscription are two separate products and cannot be converted to each other, after purchasing lifetime membership you still need to manually cancel the annual subscription. If you forgot to cancel, please refer to [here](https://support.apple.com/en-us/118223/) to request a refund.

## 9. Family Sharing
Only lifetime purchase supports Family Sharing.
