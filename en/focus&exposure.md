# Focus and Exposure

## What are Focus and Exposure?

Focusing means adjusting the camera's focal point to a specific plane, making objects on that plane appear sharp while objects on other planes appear blurred.

Exposure metering refers to the camera calculating the required aperture, shutter speed, and ISO based on the brightness of a specific area in the frame, resulting in proper exposure for that area.

## Basic Operation
No Fusion operates similarly to the default camera, where tapping on the viewfinder will simultaneously focus and meter the exposure.

## Locking
When the camera is in use, it continuously focuses and meters exposure. If you want to fix the focus on a particular spot or maintain consistent brightness, you need to use the lock function.

No Fusion handles exposure lock and focus lock separately. If you want to lock the focus on a specific point, unlike the cumbersome long-press gesture in the default camera, in No Fusion you simply need to tap the `AF` icon next to the square, and the focus will lock automatically. At this point, tapping the viewfinder again will only meter exposure, without changing the focus.

To return to autofocus, tap the `AF` icon again. Exposure lock works in the same way.
