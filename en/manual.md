# Manual Mode

## What is Manual Mode
Manual mode is often referred to as **M Mode** (Manual Mode). It refers to manually controlling all camera parameters such as [focus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_(optics)), [aperture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aperture), [shutter speed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shutter_speed), [ISO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_speed), [white balance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_balance), etc., to achieve the desired effect by the photographer.

## How to Use
Tap the `M` icon on the left of the exposure compensation to enter the manual mode adjustment interface. 
Since the iPhone does not have a physically adjustable aperture, the manual mode only includes adjustments for four parameters.

- S (Shutter Speed)
- ISO (Sensitivity)
- WB (White Balance)
- F (Focus)

Tap any parameter to enter its adjustment interface. In the adjustment interface, tap `A` to return to automatic, and tap the parameter again to return to manual control.

</p>

You can also press and drag a parameter to quickly adjust it.

</video>
</p>

Note that due to system limitations, shutter speed and ISO are linked on the iPhone. They can only both be set to automatic or both to manual.
