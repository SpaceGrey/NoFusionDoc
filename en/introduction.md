# No Fusion Core Features

## Removal of Over-Sharpening
<a id="remove-sharpening"></a>

The issue of over-sharpening on iPhones has long been a pain point, as excessive processing by the system's algorithms often results in unnatural-looking images.

No Fusion innovatively utilizes the **Apple ProRAW** pipeline along with its own calibration and compression algorithms. This produces a more natural and softer image. This format is named **HEIF**<span style="color:#FF0000; font-weight:bold">+</span> in No Fusion.

## Live Photo

Currently, only a few third-party iPhone camera apps support Live Photo capture. Even among those, including Apple's native camera, there are many limitations, such as the inability to shoot in RAW or capture 48MP photos while using Live Photo.

No Fusion not only fully supports Live Photo but also uses proprietary technology to bypass system restrictions, allowing Live Photo to be enabled in **any format and at any resolution**. This ensures that you can capture more precious moments.

## Color

Building on the more natural **HEIF**<span style="color:#FF0000; font-weight:bold">+</span> format, No Fusion incorporates powerful stylization features. It comes with multiple built-in film presets and offers a full set of color adjustment tools for users. These include basic adjustments like exposure, contrast, and saturation, as well as advanced HSL adjustments. It also supports LUT import and preset file export/import, allowing for limitless color possibilities.

## UI

Many professional camera UIs are bulky, unappealing, and lack thoughtful design, making them difficult to use. On the other hand, the default iPhone camera UI, designed for casual mobile photographers, is often too simple, lacking some professional and commonly used features. To address these issues, No Fusion reimagined and redesigned the camera experience for mobile photography. The result is a simple, efficient, and intuitive UI that strikes a balance between functionality and ease of use.
