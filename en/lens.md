## What is Focal Length
No Fusion eliminates the concept of zoom magnification on mobile phones, fully adopting the use of focal length—just like on traditional cameras—to represent lenses. Simply put, the larger the focal length number, the farther you can shoot.

## How to Use
Depending on the number of physical lenses on different devices, 2 to 4 lens groups will be displayed in the lens bar below the viewfinder. Each number represents a lens group (e.g., Ultra Wide, Wide, 2x, Telephoto), and you can switch between them by tapping the corresponding number.

## Custom Focal Length
No Fusion **does not support** two-finger zoom gestures like the default camera. If you want to set additional focal lengths, you need to use the custom focal length feature.

Each lens group corresponds to a base focal length. On top of the base focal length, you can add up to three custom focal lengths and choose a default focal length to use. The focal length in the widget will follow the default focal length.
