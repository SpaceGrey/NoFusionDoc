# Why Edit Portrait Mode in the System Photos App?

No Fusion supports generating depth data for any photo and saving it in the same portrait format as the native camera. However, due to system limitations, editing portrait mode in the third party app will lose Live Photo and the ability to adjust portrait lighting effects, which are exclusive to the system Photos app. Additionally, every change made within the app must be saved as a new photo.

Therefore, No Fusion chooses not to include built-in portrait adjustment features but instead leverages the system Photos app for editing.
