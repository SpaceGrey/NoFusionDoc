# Exposure Compensation

## What is Exposure Compensation

The default exposure compensation is set to 0, meaning that after the camera has completed automatic metering according to its algorithm, no adjustments will be made to the brightness of the image. If you are not satisfied with the brightness of the image, feeling it is either too bright or too dark, you can adjust the exposure compensation to modify the brightness. The higher the exposure compensation value, the brighter the image; conversely, the lower the value, the darker the image.

For example, in the default iOS camera, the sun icon on the focus box is used to adjust exposure compensation.

## How to Use

In No Fusion, exposure compensation adjustment is located below the viewfinder. You can slide to adjust it.

</p>

Like professional cameras, No Fusion divides exposure compensation into several different levels. The default adjustment step is `0.2`, and the adjustment range is from `-2EV` to `2EV`. If you find that the image is still not bright or dark enough, you can set the compensation adjustment to `1/3` in the settings. This will extend the adjustment range to `-3EV` to `3EV`.
