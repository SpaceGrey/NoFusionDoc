# Exposure Compensation

## What is Exposure Compensation?
The default exposure compensation is set to 0, which means that after the camera completes automatic exposure metering according to its algorithm, no adjustments are made to the brightness of the image. If you are not satisfied with the brightness of the image, feeling it is either too bright or too dark, you can adjust the exposure compensation to fine-tune the brightness. The higher the exposure compensation value, the brighter the image will be, and vice versa.

For example, the sun icon next to the focus box in the default iOS camera is used to adjust exposure compensation.

## How to Use
In No Fusion, the exposure compensation adjustment is located below the viewfinder. Simply slide to adjust.

Like a professional camera, No Fusion divides exposure compensation into several levels. The default adjustment increment is `0.2`, and the adjustment range is from `-2EV` to `2EV`. If you still find the image not bright or dark enough, you can set the exposure compensation adjustment to `1/3` in the settings, expanding the adjustment range to `-3EV` to `3EV`.
